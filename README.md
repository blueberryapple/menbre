super cool alexa skill based on [menbre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFnlXKlxuxY)

## dev env
some development environment setup is used in the project that could be useful for others:
1. using parcel to bundle your skills files so that your skill is as small as possible
2. exporting the handler with es6 style export to match aws expecting `index.handler`
